# Automated-Parameters-Extraction-

#### As part of my stutent posion one of the most frustrating chores was to manually extract MRI parameters from PDF protocols.
#### I wrote this user friendlt app to automate the process. A task that use to take a few hours per PDF now can be done within a few seconds .The user is prompt to insert the page number of the first series, and then the PDF name ,the app outputs an excel file with all the parameters required from all series at the PDF.

### Example PDF (highlighted are some of the parameters) :
